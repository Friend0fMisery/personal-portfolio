            <p>
              I was born in Honolulu, Hawaii to an Air Force Mom and Dad. After I graduated High School
              in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, I decided to join the Air Force as well. I am currently serving
              on Offutt AFB, Nebraska as a Russian linguist.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am married and have a beautiful one-year-old daughter. We live here in Omaha with our
              two Yorkies: Milo and Teddy. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Web
              Development at Bellevue University.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like to play guitar, play video games, ride my bike, hike, swim, and play with my
              daughter. I enjoy cooking dinner and watching movies.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hope to graduate with a 4.0 GPA and get out of the military in a year and a half, so
              that I can start my Web Development or Software Design career. I also plan to make
              Indie games and smartphone Apps in my free time.

              Here is the very first prototype I ever made. It was created for a project that was 
              supposed to be a single-page application on the person of my choice. I chose my wife. 
              If you click on the image, you will be taken to the repository for this project.

              with HTML/CSS. If you click on the image, you will be taken to the actual webpage,

              This is a screenshot of the GitHub repository for my Web-231 Introduction to JavaScript 
              class. Within this repository shows the progression from start to finish of the whole 
              9-week course and all of the Assignments required of me.

              Here is the actual prototype of the site you are on right now. This prototype was 
              made from the knowledge I gained from creating a dozen prototypes in my Business 
              Environment class.

              Finally, this is the latest Assignment I have worked on in my class. I thought it 
              fitting to include a snippet of code on "The Singleton Pattern", since it is my 
              namesake. By clicking on the image, you will be taken to my JavaScript II Web-330 
              repository.
